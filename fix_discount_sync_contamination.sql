-- FIX DISCOUNT SYNC CONTAMINATION
-- ========================================================================
-- This script modifies the database triggers to prevent regular registration 
-- payments from being synced to discount tables.
-- 
-- PROBLEM: Current triggers sync ALL payment updates to discount tables,
-- causing regular registration payments to contaminate discount records.
-- 
-- SOLUTION: Modify triggers to only sync when there's already a discount 
-- record for that session_id (indicating it's actually a discount payment).
-- ========================================================================

-- ====================================
-- 1. FIX NURSING TRIGGERS
-- ====================================

-- Modified function to sync from nursing_payment_records to nursing_discounts
-- ONLY if a discount record already exists (indicating this is a discount payment)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION sync_nursing_payment_to_discount()

    discount_exists BOOLEAN := FALSE;
BEGIN
    -- Check if a discount record already exists for this session_id
    SELECT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM nursing_discounts WHERE session_id = NEW.session_id) INTO discount_exists;
    
    -- Only sync if this is actually a discount payment (discount record already exists)
    IF discount_exists THEN
        -- Update corresponding discount record if it exists
        UPDATE nursing_discounts 
        SET 
            payment_intent_id = NEW.payment_intent_id,
